                        <h2>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned <br> were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. <br> I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2>
                        <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.

Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>
